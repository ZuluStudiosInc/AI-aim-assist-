Extract the ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer. You can usually do this by right-clicking the ZIP file and selecting "Extract All…" or using a file extraction tool of your choice.

Step 2: Disable Windows Firewall 
For the tool to run correctly, you need to disable your Windows Firewall temporarily. Follow these steps:

Open the Control Panel.

Go to System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall.

Click on Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off in the left-hand menu.

Select Turn off Windows Defender Firewall 

Click OK to apply the changes.

Note: Disabling your firewall can expose your computer to security risks. Ensure you re-enable it after.

Step 3: Run the Tool
Navigate to the directory where you extracted the ZIP file.

Double-click on the aim_assist.py file to run it. This will start the script and automatically install any required Python libraries.

Windows: Double-clicking the .py file should open it with Python if you have Python installed. If it does not work, you may need to run it manually using a command prompt.
Troubleshooting
Python Not Installed: If the script doesn’t run, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Download it from python.org and install it.

Libraries Installation Issue: If there are issues with installing libraries, make sure you have an internet connection and try running the script again.

Usage
After launching the script, follow the on-screen instructions to configure the aim assist settings.
